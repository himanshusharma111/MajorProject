  # Dynamic Graph Representation web-based application. 
  
  ## Interaction between google cloud firestore and java   
      
      ### Status and Technology
      
        This Project under Process. The language used in the project is Java and Java EE fundamentals. For development, I have used the Eclipse IDE. 
      This Web-based application is based on a powerful Web framework of java known as the Spring Web MVC framework.
     
      For graph representation, I have used the Chart.js library. 
      For storing the data using Firebase cloud Firestore NO SQL database. 
     
     
      ### Motive
      
         Fetching the data from google cloud firestore and view that data on the Web page in the form of Graph.
      User can see the data in the form of dynamic graph visualization. 
      Understand the basics of the Spring Framework. How to design pattern works. 
      

      ### Why Java and their sub-technologies (Java EE) and others 
      
        Spring follows some of the specifications from Java EE and overrides with better options. It is a standalone framework built on top of Java EE technology.
      I used the Spring Framework because it uses Model–view–controller software design pattern and most of the complex and big project is using architecture like this, backbone makes the project understandable, 
      reusable, plus modify any module easily. 
	  For Visualization of dynamic data to a web page, the priority is Java Server Pages (JSP) it makes the page dynamic and user interactive.
