  # Dynamic Graph Representation web-based application. 
  
  ## Interaction between google cloud Firebase Firestore and Java   
      
  ### Status and Technology
      
  This Project front-end part is under the Process and back-part is ready. The language used in the project is Java and Java EE fundamentals. For development, I have used the Eclipse IDE. 
  This Web-based application is based on a powerful Web framework of java known as the Spring Web MVC framework.
     
  For graph representation, I have used the Chart.js library. 
  
  Firebase cloud Firestore NO SQL database for storing data. 
  
     
     
   ### Motive
      
   Fetching the data from google cloud firestore and view that data on the Web page in the form of Graph.
   User can see the data in the form of dynamic graph visualization. 
   Understand the basics of the Spring Framework. 
   To understand How design pattern works. 
      

   ### Why Java their sub-technologies (Java EE) and other 
      
   Spring follows some of the specifications from Java EE and overrides with better options. It is a standalone framework built on top of Java EE technology.
   
   I used the Spring Framework because it uses Model–view–controller software design pattern and most of the complex and big project is using architecture like this, backbone 	    makes the project understandable, reusable, plus modify any module easily. 
   
   For Visualization of dynamic data to a web page, the priority is Java Server Pages (JSP) it makes the page dynamic and user interactive.
